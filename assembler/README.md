# Assembler
### Designed for terminal execution with 'make' command

This code aims to simplify the generation of the hexadecimal input instructions to be inserted in **module GR0040/GR0041** and **SOC GR0040** instruction memory in Vivado. 

The makefile is intended for Linux usage only.

Run   'make'   after setting up your assembly instructions on instructions.asm file, with or without comments (inline or multiline) to get the corresponding instructions in hexadecimal format.

Run   'make clean'   to clean the files generated by the  make  execution.


assembler_v1.c file is the simplified code, which makes up the first version of the assembler. For use without labels, this one is enough.
